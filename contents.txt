Create a Repository in Github 
Clone to your repository in Desktop
Open the repository using command "code ."
Learn about class and Objects
Explain class with Employee OR Phone
Say we have a phone , it's size,camera,weight, These are it's data
Call, taking photo are functions
So the phone can be used a class and make different objects of those classes eg:Samsung, Apple, Appo etc
An Empolyee data and it attributes , we can Create Objects
In Interview we can say, Class is a blue print for creating objects
Class has data/attributes and functions/Methods
Create a class, add a Constructor(Real use is like logging in to facebook account and when yoou login, 
your page is automatically called),crete an object for it and print the Value.
Create a method in a class and create an obj of the class and call the functions
Any data type in python is made as a class
Why Python is called OOP, because everything in python is an object(data structure,data type etc)
